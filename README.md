# Task Management Commands - SimpleClaude DNA Edition

A revolutionary task management system for AI agents that understands natural language, preserves knowledge, and enables parallel coordination. Built with SimpleClaude's DNA for maximum simplicity and power.

## üß¨ What's New: SimpleClaude DNA Transformation

This system has been completely rebuilt following SimpleClaude's architectural patterns:

- **Natural Language First**: No more flags! Just describe what you want
- **60-Line Commands**: All commands reduced from 300-500 lines to ~65 lines
- **7 Core Pattern Files**: Consolidated from 11 fragmented files
- **Living Memory**: Scratchpad as agent consciousness
- **Evidence-Based**: All decisions backed by proof
- **Think-Hard Default**: Deep analysis (8-10 thoughts) for all agents

## Overview

Transform how AI agents work on projects with:
- **Natural conversation** instead of complex flags
- **Living memory** that preserves discoveries across tasks
- **Parallel coordination** with intelligent isolation
- **Automatic thinking depth** based on complexity
- **Knowledge accumulation** that makes future tasks easier

## Commands

### `/task-plan` - Natural Task Planning
```bash
# Old way with flags
/task-plan --type feature --priority high --ultrathink

# New natural way
/task-plan create urgent email notification system with deep analysis
/task-plan fix the login bug quickly
/task-plan deeply analyze payment architecture
```

### `/task-execute` - Intelligent Execution
```bash
# Natural execution control
/task-execute all high priority tasks
/task-execute carefully work on the authentication task
/task-execute quickly run task 3
/task-execute continue blocked tasks with deep analysis
```

### `/task-status` - Conversational Monitoring
```bash
# Ask naturally about status
/task-status why are tasks blocked
/task-status show task 3 progress
/task-status analyze system performance
/task-status what's the thinking budget usage
```

### `/task-init` - Smart Initialization
```bash
# Natural setup options
/task-init with example tasks
/task-init minimal setup
/task-init restore from backup
/task-init for complex project
```

### `/task-clear` - Intelligent Cleanup
```bash
# Preserve knowledge while clearing
/task-clear completed tasks only
/task-clear everything but keep learnings
/task-clear old tasks from last month
```

## Key Features

### üß† Natural Language Intelligence
The system understands your intent without flags:
- "deeply analyze" ‚Üí ultrathink mode (10-15 thoughts)
- "carefully" ‚Üí think-hard mode (8-10 thoughts)
- "quickly" ‚Üí standard mode (3-5 thoughts)
- "urgent" ‚Üí high priority
- "bug" ‚Üí creates bug fix task

### üìù Living Memory System
Scratchpad as agent consciousness:
```markdown
## Current Understanding
[Real-time agent thoughts]

## Discoveries
[Patterns found, with evidence]

## Failed Attempts
[What didn't work and why]

## Key Commands
[Useful commands that worked]

## Next Agent Guidance
[Critical handoff information]
```

### ü§ñ Intelligent Agent Types
- **Research Agents**: Explore without writing code
- **Implementation Agents**: Build with verification
- **Validation Agents**: Ensure quality
- **Specialist Agents**: Domain-specific expertise

### üéØ Verification Targets
Prevent overfitting with:
- Visual targets (screenshots, UI mockups)
- Behavioral contracts ("must handle nulls", "< 200ms response")
- Test specifications
- Acceptance criteria

### üß¨ Knowledge Evolution
The system gets smarter over time:
- Patterns discovered in one task help future tasks
- Failed approaches are remembered
- Successful solutions evolve
- Cross-task learning automatic

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-commands.git
   cd task-management-commands
   ```

2. Copy to your project:
   ```bash
   cp -r .claude /path/to/your/project/
   ```

3. Initialize the system:
   ```bash
   /task-init
   ```

## Architecture

### Command Structure (SimpleClaude DNA)
Each command is ~65 lines following this template:
```markdown
**Purpose**: [Clear statement]
---
@include shared/task-management/includes.yml
## Command Execution
[Natural language parsing]
[Semantic transformations]
[Core workflows]
```

### Pattern Files (7 Core Files)
1. **natural-intelligence.yml** - Language understanding
2. **agent-cognition.yml** - How agents think
3. **task-workflows.yml** - Explore‚ÜíPlan‚ÜíBuild‚ÜíVerify
4. **knowledge-management.yml** - Registry & memory
5. **coordination-patterns.yml** - Multi-agent orchestration
6. **thinking-integration.yml** - Cognitive depth
7. **error-recovery.yml** - Failure handling

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Plan a complex feature with deep analysis
/task-plan deeply analyze and plan user authentication system

# 2. System automatically:
#    - Spawns research agents
#    - Explores without writing code
#    - Synthesizes findings
#    - Creates detailed spec
#    - Sets verification targets
#    - Shows: "Planning complete. Use '/task-execute {ID}' to begin"

# 3. Execute with natural control (separate command required)
/task-execute the authentication task carefully

# 4. Monitor progress naturally
/task-status why is authentication blocked

# 5. Knowledge preserved for future
# Next task benefits from discoveries
```

## Migration from Previous Version

This version uses natural language exclusively. If you're using the old flag-based system:

### Quick Translation Guide
```bash
# Old ‚Üí New
--priority high ‚Üí "urgent" or "high priority"
--ultrathink ‚Üí "deeply analyze" or "with deep analysis"
--type bug ‚Üí "fix bug" or "bug fix"
--tasks 1,2,3 ‚Üí "tasks 1, 2, and 3"
--analyze ‚Üí "analyze why" or "deep analysis"
```

**Note**: This version requires a clean installation. Old pattern files should be removed after migration.

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
./test-task-commands.sh all        # All tests
./test-task-commands.sh structure  # Command structure
./test-task-commands.sh language   # Natural language
./test-task-commands.sh evidence   # Evidence validation
```

## Philosophy

Following SimpleClaude's DNA:
- **Surface simplicity, deep power**
- **Natural language over flags**
- **Evidence over assumptions**
- **Living memory over static docs**
- **Parallel coordination over sequential**
- **Learning system over static tools**

## Creating New Commands

Follow the **SYSTEM-DNA.md** blueprint in `.claude/shared/` to create new commands that maintain our architectural principles. The DNA document provides:
- Complete command template
- Pattern file structure
- Natural language guidelines
- Testing requirements

## Future Vision

This system will continue evolving based on real usage:
- More natural language patterns
- Smarter agent coordination
- Deeper knowledge synthesis
- Visual task understanding
- Cross-project learning
