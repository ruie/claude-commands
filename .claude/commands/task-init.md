**Purpose**: Initialize intelligent task management system with natural setup process

---

@include shared/task-management/includes.yml

## Command Execution

**If "$ARGUMENTS" is empty**: Perform standard initialization  
**If "$ARGUMENTS" has content**: Parse initialization preferences

Transforms: "$ARGUMENTS" into setup configuration:

- What: [initialization scope]
- How: [setup approach]
- Options: [configuration preferences]
- Mode: [fresh or restore]

**One-Time Setup**: Creates the complete task management infrastructure for AI agent workflows.

Natural language system initialization that sets up workspace, registry, and cognitive patterns.

### Semantic Transformations

```
"initialize with example tasks" →
  What: full system setup
  How: include sample tasks
  Options: demo mode enabled
  Mode: fresh start

"restore from backup" →
  What: system restoration
  How: recover previous state
  Options: preserve history
  Mode: restore mode

"minimal setup" →
  What: core components only
  How: skip optional features
  Options: lean configuration
  Mode: minimal

"init for complex project" →
  What: full featured setup
  How: all capabilities enabled
  Options: advanced patterns
  Mode: comprehensive
```

Examples:

- `/task-init` - Standard setup with all features
- `/task-init with examples` - Include demonstration tasks
- `/task-init minimal` - Basic setup only
- `/task-init restore from yesterday` - Recover previous state

**Context Detection**: Setup needs → Configuration options → Directory structure → Registry initialization

## Core Workflows

**Structure Phase**: Create directories → Initialize registry → Setup templates → Configure patterns  
**Registry Phase**: Version 2.0 schema → Default settings → Priority queues → Thinking metrics  
**Template Phase**: Task specs → Scratchpad format → Verification targets → Agent instructions  
**Validation Phase**: Verify structure → Test registry → Confirm access → Ready notification
