**Purpose**: [Single clear statement about command intent]

---

@include shared/task-management/includes.yml

## Command Execution

**If "$ARGUMENTS" is empty**: Display conversational usage examples  
**If "$ARGUMENTS" has content**: Parse natural language intent

Transforms: "$ARGUMENTS" into structured workflow:

- What: [extracted goal]
- How: [approach strategy]  
- Depth: [thinking mode]
- Agents: [delegation plan]

**Agent Orchestration**: Spawn specialized agents based on task complexity and natural language cues.

[Main command description - How natural language transforms into task management actions]

### Semantic Transformations

```
"[natural language example 1]" →
  What: [specific goal]
  How: [execution approach]
  Depth: [think-hard/ultrathink]
  Agents: [research/implementation/validation]

"[natural language example 2]" →
  What: [different goal]
  How: [different approach]
  Depth: [thinking depth]
  Agents: [agent strategy]
```

Examples:

- `/[command] [conversational request]` - [What happens]
- `/[command] [different request]` - [Different behavior]
- `/[command] [complex request]` - [Advanced behavior]

**Context Detection**: Natural language → Intent extraction → Complexity assessment → Mode selection → Agent spawning

## Core Workflows

**Research Phase**: Agents explore → Gather patterns → Document findings → Synthesize knowledge  
**Planning Phase**: Analyze complexity → Break down tasks → Define boundaries → Set verification targets  
**Execution Phase**: Parallel agents → Continuous documentation → Registry updates → Progress tracking  
**Verification Phase**: Check targets → Validate criteria → Ensure quality → Preserve learnings
