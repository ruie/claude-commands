# Thinking Mode Patterns

Thinking_Modes:
  standard:
    description: "Basic analysis"
    thought_count: "3-5"
    use_cases:
      - "Simple queries"
      - "Straightforward fixes"
      - "Documentation updates"
    tool: "Not required"
  think_hard:
    description: "Deep analysis (DEFAULT)"
    thought_count: "8-10"
    use_cases:
      - "All task planning"
      - "All agent execution"
      - "Complex debugging"
      - "Architecture decisions"
    tool: "mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking"
    is_default: true
  ultrathink:
    description: "Maximum analysis"
    thought_count: "10-15"
    use_cases:
      - "Complex architecture design"
      - "Multi-system integration"
      - "Performance optimization"
      - "Security-critical features"
    tool: "mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking"
    requires: "--ultrathink flag"

Default_Behavior:
  task_planning:
    mode: "think-hard"
    automatic: true
    message: "ðŸ§  Think-hard mode active by default - Using deep analysis (8-10 thoughts)"
  agent_execution:
    mode: "think-hard"
    automatic: true
    instructions: "Use sequential thinking for all complex decisions"
  task_status_analysis:
    mode: "think-hard"
    trigger: "--analyze flag"
    focus: "Blocker root cause analysis"

Ultrathink_Mode:
  activation:
    - "User includes --ultrathink flag"
    - "Explicit request for maximum analysis"
    - "Task complexity score > 8/10"
  characteristics:
    - "10-15 sequential thoughts"
    - "Exhaustive edge case analysis"
    - "Multiple approach evaluation"
    - "Risk assessment for each option"
    - "Prevention of constraint overfitting"
  output_enhancement:
    - "Detailed decision rationale"
    - "Alternative approaches considered"
    - "Risk mitigation strategies"
    - "Future-proofing considerations"
    - "Performance implications"

Budget_Tracking:
  metrics:
    total_thoughts:
      description: "Cumulative thought count"
      tracking: "Per task and globally"
    thought_distribution:
      planning: "Thoughts used in planning phase"
      execution: "Thoughts used during implementation"
      debugging: "Thoughts used for problem-solving"
    efficiency_score:
      calculation: "Subtasks completed / thoughts used"
      target: "> 0.1 (1 subtask per 10 thoughts)"
  reporting:
    - "Show in task-status output"
    - "Track in registry thinking_metrics"
    - "Alert on unusual consumption"
    - "Suggest mode upgrades when needed"

Subagent_Delegation:
  triggers:
    - "External API documentation needed"
    - "Complex error investigation"
    - "Pattern search across codebase"
    - "Framework best practices research"
    - "Performance profiling required"
  best_practices:
    - "Delegate early to preserve context"
    - "Provide specific, focused prompts"
    - "Request structured output"
    - "Verify and integrate findings"
    - "Track delegation count"
  efficiency_gains:
    - "Parent preserves decision context"
    - "Parallel information gathering"
    - "Specialized tool usage"
    - "Reduced token consumption"
    - "Faster turnaround"
